1. **Dependence on Data Quality**: The accuracy of the IGS model heavily relies on the quality of the medical images and clinical data. Any inaccuracies or missing data in the input features (such as tumor size, shape, or density) can lead to incorrect predictions.
2. **Limited Generalization to rare cases**: The model may not generalize well rare cases that differ significantly from the training dataset. This can affect its performance in diagnosing atypical tumor types or unusual clinical presentations.
3. **Potential Overfitting to Specific Features**: The model may overfit to certain features that are highly represented in the training data, such as common tumor characteristics. This could result in reduced accuracy when encountering tumors with different or less common attributes.
